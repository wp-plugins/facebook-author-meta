= How To Use: =
* **Please Read Carefully**
1. By default this plugin automatically sets the **author name** for all **post/pages** etc. i.e. for all **single** post/pages.
	* This plugin **gets the author name** of each **post/page** etc. and set it as a **autor name** for **facebook meta**.
	* **Note:** Default value is your **public name** i.e name you set in your profile => ***[Display name publicly as]***.
	* You can set your own custom author name for all **post/pages** here **Settings >> Facebook Author Meta**.
2. By default this plugin does not automatically sets **author name** for **archives, category, tags, hompage, date archives** etc. You can set your **custom author name** for all these pages in settings page of this plugin.

= Note: =
* If you want to set **same author name** for whole website/blog  goto ***Settings >> Facebook Author Meta*** and fill both the fields with **same author name**.
